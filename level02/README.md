# Level 02

This time we have a pcap file in the current directory name `level02.pcap`.

A PCAP file is a file containing network packet data. We can open it with Wireshark.

We can right click on a request and do "Follow" then click on "TCP Stream".

```tcp
Password: ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L
```

Here, dots are backspaces. So the final password is `ft_waNDReL0L`

Now we can log as flag02 with `ft_waNDReL0L`.
